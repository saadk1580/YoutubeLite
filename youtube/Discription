I used a constructor to set the initial state of the video elements and bind the methods. To display the first instance of trending videos I used react 
hook ‘componentDidMount’ with async so I can fetch the data from API. Inside the function I made a GET request with base params and I assigned the data 
to a constant variable named ‘res’. Because the data is in JSON format I was able to manipulate the data to get specific elements using keys and values 
and used foreach function to assign values to elements for the video i.e., date of upload, thumbnail, channel name. Then I assigned those values of to 
the keys in the state object using setState. 

The other function called ‘handleEnter’ is async function for to show results when a term is searched in the search box. It works almost the same as 
‘componentDidMount’ but the state of the elements is changed when pressed enter or the search button is clicked after typing in the term. The ‘keypress’ 
function is triggered when the enter key is pressed in the input box which calls the ‘handleEnter’ function.  The ‘ShowData’ component is used to make a 
layout for the video elements and the ‘YouTubeAPI’ is for making a GET request using Axios. 

The challenging part of this project was to inherit information from other components. I used props which made it much easier. I was able to pass on the 
information using JSX components and other components were able to use that information using props.[info]. It also made my code much easier to organize 
and easy to read as different components had different tasks and how they were interlinked. For the safety of the API key, I created a .env file to store 
the API so it won’t display in the build of the app.
